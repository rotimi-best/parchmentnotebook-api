How do I calculate prayer streaks?
- Get the streaks number from the user object

A) How to increment the streak?
  PUT /prayer/1
  Body - prayed: Boolean

  if (prayed === true) {
    if (user.lastDatePrayed === yesterday && user.lastDatePrayed !== today) {
      updateUser({ userId }, {
        lastDatePrayed: new Date(date()).getTime(), // today
        { $inc: { streak: 1 } }
      })
    }
  }

- When the user marks a prayer as prayed today, then
  - update user.lastDatePrayed

How do I calculate the prayer points for the day
const { startDate, endDate } = prayer;
const today = Date.now();

This means that today is within the startDate to endDate;
if (startDate <= today && endDate >= today) {

}

Use case flow.
